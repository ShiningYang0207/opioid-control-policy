Some changes I made in this modification:

- interpolate the counties that don't have drug-related data with the state-year level drug-related mortality rate
(Calculation of state-year mortality rate: 1. Aggregate population on state-year level; 2. Aggregate number of drug-related deaths on state-year level; 3. Calculate the ratio between these two)

- PLEASE NOTE: actually in the analysis we are using Montana as a control state for Washington, but we mistakenly put it as Minnesota in the report. So please change that in the report!

- The plots (PNG format) are stored in 35_modified_plotting folder, you can use that directly

- The summary stats are in 25_modified_modeling folder

- Shining is already FRIED!ðŸ˜©
